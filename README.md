# Use RUST to build dynamic link library and use that on C++ Project

This project is to show how to make dynamic link library using RUST and how can we use that on C++ project.

Here, main project is composed with CMake so it can be compiled on multi-platform environment.

## Install Prerequisite

This is tested on Ubuntu-24.04.

#### 1. Install Rust

Use this command to install RUST.

```

#### 2. Install cmake, make, g++

Use these commands to install.

```
sudo apt install cmake make g++ -y
```

## Build Rust Project

Use this command to build RUST Project.

```
